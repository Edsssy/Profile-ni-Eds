            <p>
                Edwrelyn S. Buhian is a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student residing in General Trias, Cavite. 
                She has a passion for technology and networks, focusing on understanding their functionality and 
                interconnectivity. While she enjoys programming, her primary interest lies in networking and systems.
                <br><br>
                In her free time, Edwrelyn watches TikTok, anime, and K-dramas, especially those in the mystery and 
                fantasy genres. She has experience hosting school events and is expanding her skills to host events 
                outside of school. Eager to learn and take on challenges, Edwrelyn is committed to both academic 
                and personal growth.

                In addition to her academic pursuits, Edwrelyn is a working student employed at Telco Services 
                International (TSI) Ltd. Pty., located in the Five E-Com Center within the Mall of Asia Complex 
                in Pasay City. Her motivation for working is to financially support her family's needs and to ensure 
                she has funds available for her parents' medical check-ups.
                <br><br>
                Balancing work and study is a common scenario for many Filipino students, often driven by 
                economic constraints. This dual role not only provides financial support but also offers valuable 
                professional experience and networking opportunities. Edwrelyn's dedication to managing both 
                responsibilities highlights her commitment to her family's well-being and her personal development.
